              <h1>A Visual Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors</h1>
              <h2>K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) is an algorithm used to classify data based on its 'nearest', or most similar, counterparts. In this interactive tutorial, we walk you through the basics of K-NN and demonstrate the logic behind it.</h2>

            <p id='part1'>Let's start with something small. We've got two points in the graph on the right. We have classified them as <span id='bluetext'>blue</span> and <span id='redtext'>red</span>. <button id='btn1'>OK, cool</button><p>
            <p id='part2'>Now, let's say we have a new point to add to our dataset. We want to classify it based on the data that we already have. <button id='btn2'>Let's do it</button></p><br />
            <p id='part3'>In this case, the nearest neighbor to our new point is the <span id='bluetext'>blue</span> point. Thus, we will classify this point as <span id='bluetext'>blue</span>. <button id='btn3'>Got it</button></p><br />
            <p id='part4'>In fact - if we are classifying a point based only on our two original points, we can draw a line right down the middle. If the new point falls on the left side, we classify it as <span id='bluetext'>blue</span>. If it falls to the right, we classify it as <span id='redtext'>red</span>. This line is called the <strong>decision boundary</strong>.

            In the previous section, we illustrated what a decision boundary looks like between two points. However, we will usually have datasets larger than this. The graph on the right contains five data points: four points plotted with the fifth being defined by your cursor. Each line on the graph represents a decision boundary. This type of graph is called a <strong>voronoi diagram</strong>. Move your cursor around the graph and note how the decision boundaries move with it. If we were to add a new point to our graph, we would classify it based on the corresponding point in the area it fell in. You can play around with the sliders and reshuffle the data to get a better understanding for how these decision boundaries are made.<br />

            Time to kick it up a notch. In the previous section, we classified our data based on a single nearest neighbor data point. Now, we are going to expand on this and classify new data points based on <strong>k</strong>-nearest neighbors, where k is equal to the number of <em>neighbors</em> used for the classification. We'll start with a k value of 3. We have a new point in our data set that we want to classify: the green point. First, we locate the three data points that are closest to this new point. We then take a vote from these nearest neighbors to determine which class our new data point will fall in. Move our green point around by clicking on the graph to see who are his nearest neighbors.
